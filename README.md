# Floor is lava.

This prject introduces the fundamentals of Unity game development by building a simple 3D platformer called "Floor is Lava." The player must navigate a floating pathway without touching the ground, because the floor is lava!

## Project Overview

Learn Unity basics by designing a 3D scene, implementing player movement and jumping, enhancing the visual environment with assets and textures, and adding basic game logic for failure conditions.

## Features

- 3D level design using unity primitives.
- Player controller using C# (movement + jump)
- Visual design using Asset Store materials
- Game over Logic when falling into lava
- Organized scene and asset hierarchy

## Gameplay Instructions

- Move the player with **WASD** or **Arrow** keys.
- Jump using Spacebar.
- Avoid falling off the pathway, the floor is lava!
  
If the player touches the floor, a "Game Over" message is shown, and the player is removed from the scene.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
- Open the project in Unity
- Open FloorIsLavaScene.unity
- Press Play to start testing
